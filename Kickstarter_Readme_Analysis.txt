# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

 For the Kickstarter Challenge, I am helping Louise compare fundraising campaigns to find the best way to kickstart her play *Fever*. By comparing launch date and goals of other plays, she will be able to see what campaigns have been successful in the past.

### Purpose
	
 The purpose of this analysis is to determine the best timing to launch Louise's campaign and what goal ammounts have been successful for plays in the past. In this analysis, we compared a variety of plays and how they faired during their campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges
 
 Challenges for the analysis came from some formula errors- I overcame them by fixing typos, confirming correct columns needed when filtering information, and using the necessary filters. By using filters that were not needed (ie. specifying the US for country), it gave a smaller look at information for Louise to make an informed decision. Incorrect financial information would have mislead Louise on how plays faired monetarily.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Campaigns that started in May and June had the most successful launches compared to the rest of the year, however there was a large decline for the rest of the year until a small peak in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 
By looking at the graph for outcomes based on goals, it can be determined that there was no direct correlation between amount raised and the success of the of the plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were some difficulties finding the results, but after double checking formulas and filters neeeded, I was able to gather the information Louise was looking for to help start her campaign.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

 Based on launch date, we know that May and June had the best start dates, after that the summer months declined in success. There was a slight peak in both February and October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the outcomes vs goals chart, we can see there was no direct correltion between financial goals and the success of the plays. While smaller budgets did well acheiving their goals and had successful projects, bigger budget projects were not always successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 
The dataset is limited by what was done at face value, was there more done on how the campaigns raised money, who was involved, details about the projects. Could some of the campaigns had more success if they were within a better budget?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Possible tables to look into would include number of donors and average donation, how long campaigns lasted, and how campaigns faired in different countries.
